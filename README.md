# NLP_Preprocessing

NLP (Natural Language Processing) preprocessing refers to the techniques used to clean, normalize, and prepare text data for use in NLP models.
Common preprocessing steps include:

1. Tokenization: breaking text into individual words or phrases
2. Lowercasing: converting all text to lowercase
3. Removing punctuation and special characters
4. Removing stop words: commonly used words that do not carry much meaning, such as "a," "the," and "is"
5. Contraction mapping
6. Lemmatization or stemming: reducing words to their base form to reduce the dimensionality of the data
7. Handling accented character
8. Removing any other unwanted characters or formatting
9. Removing the numerics.
10. Removing the URLs
11. Removing the mentions like (@username)

These preprocessing steps help to standardize the text data and make it easier for NLP models to understand and process.
